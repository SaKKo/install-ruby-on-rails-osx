# Installing Ruby on Rails 4.2.x on OSX

The current version available is 4.2.3

## Prerequisites

1. OSX Yosemite (latest version preferred)
1. Install Xcode (latest version now is 6.4)
    1. Make sure you open Xcode once.
    1. Create and iOS project (any kind of project). Then build and run it in simulator. It will ask you to enable developer mode. Please make sure that you **enable** it.
1. Install command line tool.
    1. Try typing the word `git --version` in terminal. It should show git version, if not, there should be a popup screen that will download/install for you.
    1. Google for `command line tools download`

## Let's start with RVM

RVM is the Ruby enVironment Manager (rvm). You will learn about it more later.

To install, follow these instructions

1. `curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=enabled`
    1. with this, you now have rvm in your computer
    1. You must close and re-open terminal again after the installation is done.
1. `rvm requirements`
    1. this is to ensure all dependencies are installed
    1. usually, it will automatically install `homebrew` for you.
    1. it might ask for your root password.
    1. The other options that require your input, you can just press enter which will use default.

Now `rvm` should be ready. taken from [github](https://github.com/rvm/rvm)

## Install ruby

I'm using the latest 2.2 at the moment

1. `rvm install 2.2`
1. `rvm use 2.2 --default`

## Install rubygems

Rubygems is like a collection of ruby libraries create by the communities.

1. `rvm rubygems current`

## Installing Rails

Ruby on Rails® is an open-source web framework that’s optimized for programmer happiness and sustainable productivity. It lets you write beautiful code by favoring convention over configuration.

You can install it using rubygems

1. echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc
    1. Rubygems by default install documentation for you. The command above will prevent documentation from being installed on your computer. (I don't like wasting my SSD)
1. `gem install rails`
    1. this could take a long time.

Check rails version by typing

1. `rails --version`
    1. It's usually the latest version (currently 4.2.3)

## Install nodejs

Rails most important requirements is nodejs. You can download and install from [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) website.

## Moving on

Your computer should be ready for rails development.

Happy coding
